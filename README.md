# Multi-Frequency Signal Generator with MATLAB GUI | Academic Project

Technologies: ATmega328P, Embedded C, Analog Filters, MATLAB, FFT

Designed a programmable signal generator using an ATmega328P microcontroller to produce 2 Hz, 90 Hz, and 700 Hz waveforms.

Implemented active analog filtering circuits to convert square waves into clean sine waves, significantly reducing total harmonic distortion (THD).

Developed a MATLAB-based graphical user interface for:

Real-time waveform visualization

FFT and spectral analysis

Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) simulation

Bridged embedded hardware and software analysis tools to validate signal integrity and system performance.

👉 This project strongly signals signal processing + embedded firmware competence.
